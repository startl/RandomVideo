# RandomVideo
Random display of local videos like a web page

**Display local video randomly like a web page, double-click to play**  
**The display directory can be customized, added or disabled at any time**  
**You can customize the number of simultaneous displays**  

Using Qt development, it can cross platform in theory.  

Ffmpeg is used to generate the thumbnail, so there will be delay for the first time, just after the establishment of the thumbnail.  

Below the software is the toolbar   
Change button: randomly switch the video, double-click on the video to play  
Rebuild thumbnail button: create a database, wait patiently for the completion of the establishment, and the switch will be very fast in the future  
Set button: custom function
